# Knowledge Graph

Definition: Knowledge Graphs/Bases describes real-world *entities* and their *relations*, organized in a *graph*.

A graph consists of a RDF triplet `(Subject or Head, Relation, Object or Tail)`. 

There are three elements within a knowledge graph:
- **Entities**: Named objects in the world
- **Properties**: Relationships between two entities
- **Types**: Sets or classes of entities
    - Entity types (attributes)
    - Relationship types

## Knowledge Extraction Process
1. Information Retrieval
2. Information Extraction
    - Dependency Parsing, Part of Speech, Named Entity Recognition (Entity Extraction)
    - Document Coreference Resolution
    - Entity Resolution, Entity Linking, Relation Extraction

## Problems in Information Extraction
The below problems could be solved via supervised(manual), semi-supervised, unsupervised, which has a precision and recall trade-off.
1. Defining domain: Define subset of types, discover new types, nouns as entities and verbs as relation
2. Learning extractors: Create examples, find patterns
3. Scoring candidate facts: human defined, multiple iterations, confidence threshold

## Glossary

RDF: Resource Description Framework is a standard model for interchanging data on the web even if the underlying schemas differ.

Semantic Web: is a vision of a web of linked data proposed by Tim Berners-Lee. It is thought of as an extention of the current World Wide Web in which applications are connected to form a consistent logical web of data and information is given a well-defined meaning (semantics), making it readable not only to humans, but also machines

Ontology: (Metaphysics, Philosophy) a study of the nature of existence and the structure of reality. (Semantic Web) Ontology investigates the categories of things that exist or may exist in a particular domain. Ontologies are used to refer to the semantic understanding, the conceptual framework of knowledge, shared by individuals who participate in a given domain. 

OWL: is a semantic web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things.
